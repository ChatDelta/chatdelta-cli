community a harassment-free experience for everyone.

## Our Standards

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery

## Our Responsibilities

behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

individual is officially representing the project.
